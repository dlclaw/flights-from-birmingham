How to monetize your flight deal discovery site and maximize earnings.

---

## Revenue Streams

### 1. Flight Affiliate Commissions (Primary)

**Source:** Kiwi.com affiliate program  
**Commission:** 0.5-1% of booking value  
**Payment:** Monthly via PayPal  
**Cookie Duration:** 30 days

**How it works:**
- User clicks "View Deal" on your site
- Redirects to Kiwi.com with your affiliate ID
- User books within 30 days → you earn commission
- Commission credited to your account
- Paid out monthly (minimum £25)

**Example earnings:**
```
Booking value: £200
Commission rate: 1%
Your earnings: £2

10 bookings/month = £20
50 bookings/month = £100
100 bookings/month = £200
```

### 2. Display Advertising (Secondary)

**When to add:** After 1,000+ daily visitors

**Options:**
- **Google AdSense** - Easy setup, low earnings (~£0.50 RPM)
- **Mediavine** - High earnings (~£5-10 RPM) but needs 50k sessions/month
- **Ezoic** - Good middle ground, AI-optimized

**Estimated earnings:**
```
1,000 visitors/day = 30,000/month
£2 RPM average = £60/month
```

**⚠️ Warning:** Ads may reduce affiliate clicks. Test carefully!

### 3. Email List (Future)

**Strategy:** Build email list for price alerts

**Monetization:**
- Send weekly best deals
- Sponsored deals from airlines
- Premium features (paid tier)

**Potential:**
```
1,000 subscribers
5% click-through = 50 clicks
10% conversion = 5 bookings
£10/booking commission = £50/week
```

### 4. Sponsored Destinations (Advanced)

**Once you have traffic:**
- Airlines pay to feature routes
- Tourism boards sponsor destination guides
- Hotels/car rentals cross-sell

**Typical rates:**
```
Featured destination: £100-500/month
Sponsored content: £50-200/post
Newsletter sponsor: £50-150/send
```
